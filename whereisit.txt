What’s What and What’s Where and What’s Important

FE:
Profile Page - code/web/src/modules/user/Profile.js
	(Need) Edit Page - code/web/src/modules/user/Edit.js
	(Need) Items Page - code/web/src/modules/user/Items.js

Routes for users live in - code/web/src/setup/routes/user.js
	This is probably where we’ll specify a new route to user/profile/edit

*Maddy - Might need state file access for users


BE:
Migrations: code/api/src/migrations/1-user.js
	Might need to update a migration for products and crates to join them together??

User ‘Model’: code/api/src/modules/user/model.js
	Will need to update this model and it’s ‘model methods’ / ‘query methods’ located at:
	code/api/src/modules/user/mutations.js
	code/api/src/modules/user/query.js
	code/api/src/modules/user/resolvers.js

code/api/src/setup/schema/ seems to be a place we’ll need to make changes if we were to add another DB table


Notes:
	code/web/src/modules/user/api/actions.js
		This file contains import cookie.  Maybe this is where the user ID will live?
		js-cookie is a package that is installed in code/web/package.json
		There is also a function called ‘setUser’ which might be important for knowing what profile we’re looking at
		Finally, there’s stuff about ”User Authentication” here code/web/src/setup/client/index.js

	when I created myself as a user my role was default set to [null] - weird

	when you subscribe to a crate it adds that to the DB

	We’re supposed to be tracking items shipped and kept, but items don’t seem to have any relation to anything… seems like they should belong to a crate?

  * Jenny - Should we be creating a new user and adding product to the profile?  Should we be using seed/existing user data?
    Seed file is called seeders, located in: api/src/seeders
